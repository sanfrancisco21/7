    <h2>Artsy Robot</h2>

    <p>The Artsy Robot was a project that I did for my Mechatronics class a while back. It started off as a simple
      autonomous robot that was able to back up and turn to avoid collisions (note the distance sensor on the front).
      Later on, I wrote a program that allowed my robot to follow a premade path. By attaching a marker to the back, I
      was able to program the robot to draw simple (i.e. continuous) shapes and patterns. </p>

    <h2>Exploring the ESP32 Board's Bluetooth Capabilities</h2>

    <p>This project was an incredible opportunity to work with SparkFun Electronics to develop tutorials for the ESP32
      Thing Plus C. I learned a lot from this project team, and it's awesome that my writing is published online now.
      I've attached links to the two tutorials below if you want to check them out! </p>
